# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our community
a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or
invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and
expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality,
personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse,
inclusive, and healthy community.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment for our community include:

- Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people
- Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
- Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
- Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes,
  and learning from the experience
- Focusing on what is best for the community

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

- The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances
- Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
- Public or private harassment
- Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic
  address, without explicit permission
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a
  professional setting

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable
behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior that
they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments,
commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of
Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces when an individual
is representing the project or its community. Examples of representing a project or community
include using an official project e-mail address, posting via an official social media account,
or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event. Representation may be
further defined and clarified by project maintainers.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by
contacting the project team at [synaptosearch@gmail.com](mailto:synaptosearch@gmail.com). All
complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

All project maintainers are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the reporter of
any incident.

## Enforcement Guidelines

Project maintainers will determine in good faith whether an incident constitutes a violation
of this Code of Conduct and what action should be taken. Remedial actions may include a
warning, temporary or permanent removal of privileges or access, or expulsion from the
community.

## Attribution

This Code of Conduct is adapted from the Contributor Covenant, version 2.1,
available at [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org).
